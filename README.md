# EDA_Red_Wine_Data

The EDA conducted on the red wine dataset began with a thorough inspection of the datasetâ€™s structure and contents. The initial steps included loading the dataset and examining the first few records to understand the nature of the variables. A summary of the dataset was generated, revealing the presence of 12 physicochemical attributes such as acidity levels, sugar content, pH, and alcohol, along with a quality score serving as the target variable.

A check for missing values was performed, and the dataset was confirmed to be clean with no null entries. The data types of each column were validated to ensure consistency for further analysis. Descriptive statistics, including measures of central tendency and dispersion (mean, median, standard deviation, min, and max), were computed for each numerical feature, offering insights into the data distribution.

Correlation analysis was carried out using a heatmap to identify relationships between features. Notably, features like alcohol and volatile acidity showed strong correlations with wine quality, guiding potential feature selection for modeling. Visualizations such as histograms and boxplots were employed to explore the distribution and presence of outliers across various features. Pairplots and scatter plots further highlighted relationships and patterns among variables.

Additionally, the dataset was grouped by wine quality scores to analyze how feature values differ across quality levels. This included plotting mean values of features against different quality ratings to detect trends. Overall, the EDA provided a solid foundation for understanding the dataset's characteristics, uncovering key patterns, and preparing the data for predictive modeling.
